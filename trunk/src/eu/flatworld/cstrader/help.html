			box set the minimum percent profit that is acceptable. Any trade
			route that is under the minimum will be pruned and not displayed
			in the Routes pane. The default is 0, which means that the route
			must at least show some profit. Clearing the box will eliminate

			profit level, then leave the box empty. A positive number can be

			trade routes to use only the indicated amount of cargo space. If
			possible, CSTrader will take into account the unit weight of an
			item in determining the quantity to trade. This box can be set to
			the value of the cargo space of the users ship. It can be set to
			less if the ship already has some cargo on board, or the user
			wants to reserve some space for another use. Leaving this box
			blank will not limit trades by weight. This value is saved and

                            <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Credit Limit filter box<BR>Limits

			includes all of the named systems as well as the numbered
			expanses. CSTrader uses this information to calculate how many
			turns it takes to get to the From system for a trade route. The
			special value NoSystem will cause CSTrader to assume that you are
			already at the From location. This is useful when composing routes
			with multiple trades. 
                                </P>

                            <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hyper Jump box<BR>When moving
			between systems, the Hyper Jump value is used to calculate the
			turn cost. Each ship has it's own Hyper Jump value. Find it by
			selecting “My Ships” at the top of the Chosen Space window,
			and clicking on the CLASS of the ship. The Hyper Jump value will
			be at the bottom. Leaving out the Hyper Jump value will throw the

                            <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Light Speed box<BR>The Light
