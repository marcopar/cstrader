        <b><i>About Expanse names</i></b><br/>
        Expanse are named using a system of coordinates that has is origin in the center of the galaxy.
        The letters N,E,W,S are the cardinal points as we are used to see them on maps.
        N2E2 means 2 squares in North direction and 2 East, that are the coordinates of Raxia.
        An extensive discussion of this system of coordinates can be found here: http://forum.pbbghub.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=11583
        <br/><b><i>About loading pricelists from HTML source</i></b><br/>
        Copying pricelists from the HTML source requires more clicks but gives more information such as grid and sector of starbases.
        This information can be used to perform better calculations when moving at lightspeed.
        <br/><b><i>About sector, grid and lightspeed</i></b><br/>
        Sector and grid are used to calculate the exact turns needed to move when the trip is done at light speed.<br/>
        The current formula should be accurate to within a turn or two of the actual game turns.<br/>
        The formula is used only when you fill both grid and sector field AND when you load pricelists from HTML source.<br/>
        To deactivate the formula put an empty value in grid and sector.<br/>
        The total turn cost is the sum of the turns needed to go from the current location to the start of the route and the turn cost of the route.<br/>
        <b><i>About hyperjumps</i></b><br/>
        The formula used for hyperjumps is an approximation of the real formula but it quite precise.<br/>
        If you have information about the real formula write me.<br/>
        The total turn cost is the sum of the turns needed to go from the current location to the start of the route and the turn cost of the route.<br/>
        <b><i>About the weight</i></b><br/>
        The weight of an item is specified in pricelists only when it is for sale.<br/>
        This means that if the item is only wanted, it's impossible to know its price.<br/>
        To overcome this the software learns and remember the weights of the items while it sees them.
        If the weight of an item is unknown a value of 1IT per unit is assumed.<br/>

        <UL>
            <li>New expanses.</li>
        </UL>
        <font size="+1"><b>Version 0.9.6</b></font><br/>
        <UL>
            <li>Statistics page.</li>

        <font size="+1"><b>Version 0.9.5</b></font><br/>
        <UL>
            <LI>Added a Help:Help menu item. Started a real help file. Needs work.</LI>
            <LI>Lightspeed transfers turn cost calculation.</LI>
            <LI>Added the available credits limit field.</LI>
            <LI>Added clear all pricelists button in galaxy price list panel.</LI>
            <LI>Fixed bug with Export Pricelist where all weights were 0. Weight is accurate now.
            <LI>New functionality for ImportPriceList - can now parse the raw HTML form of price list. IE: "view source", cut and paste.
                The HTML source has the exact location data for each planet and SB.
            <LI>Made quantity field of system and galaxy pricelists editable. Handy if
                someone beat you to that deal on Tetrium.  NOTE: lists need to be re-sorted
                after changing a quantity, but the change is immediately reflected in routes and
                pricelists. </LI>
            <LI>Added "optimal" turns calculation. System-to-system and grid-to-grid travel uses
                a rounded distance formula. Sometimes it is shorter to break the trip up
                into smaller jumps.  The optTurns figures out what the turn cost would be if
                broken into 1-unit jumps. Does not apply to sector travel, which uses ad
                different formula.</LI>
            <LI>Added tooltip to route table showing optimal turn cost and TP/TC.</LI>
            <LI>Added ExportAll button to galaxy pricelist panel.</LI>
            <LI>Added UpdateAll button in galaxy pricelist. Updates all pricelists from a
                single concatenated text or HTML input.</LI>
            <LI>Now pricelists can be saved/loaded via the import/export pricelist dialogs.
                This works for galaxy (ALL) pricelists as well.
                NOTE: save file dialog doesn't ask about existing files, so you can stomp on a file
                when saving if you are not careful.  You'd think the standard save dialog would include
                that feature.  Oh well.  Be careful, kids.</LI>
            <LI>Available Turns limit filter.
            <LI>Fixed minor bug with the lightSpeed field.
        </UL>

        <font size="+1"><b>Version 0.9.4</b></font><br/>
        <UL>
            <LI>Changed the internal pricelist format. As a side effect all your pricelists have been wiped. Sorry.
            <LI>Fixed turn calculation in order to reflect game changes.
        </UL>
        <font size="+1"><b>Version 0.9.3.2</b></font><br/>

            <li>Fixed a huge stupid bug that was stopping first time users to start the program. Spread the word if you know one of them.</li>

        <font size="+1"><b>Version 0.9.3.1</b></font><br/>

            <li>Fixed bug about total profit for weights greater than 1.</li>
            <li>Weight support.</li>
            <li>Tooltips.</li>
        </ul>

        <font size="+1"><b>Version 0.9.2</b></font><br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Added location filters</li>
            <li>Added better filter support in system pricelists</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <font size="+1"><b>Version 0.9.0</b></font><br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Added turn cost of a route</li>
            <li>Added TP/TC (Total profit / Turn cost)</li>
            <li>Added TP/TC filter</li>
